# RC end-to-end checklist (computer-use)

A manual smoke-test checklist for validating a release candidate on a real desktop,
via the computer-use workflow described in `AGENTS.md` § Desktop E2E testing with
computer-use. Originates from the maintainer's pre-1.5 testing checklist; extended
with everything added since that a unit/browser test can't exercise (native capture,
tray, real audio/webcam devices, real window management).

Use this top to bottom for an RC. Check off each item as you verify it; note the
build/commit tested and any findings (with a linked issue) at the bottom.

## How to run this

1. Launch the build under test (`npm run dev` for a branch/worktree, or the packaged
   RC installer for a full release candidate).
2. Grant computer-use access to the app's process (`electron.exe` for a dev build,
   `Openscreen.exe`/`Openscreen.app` for a packaged build).
3. Work through the sections in order — later sections (Editor, Persistence) depend
   on having a real recording from the Capture section.
4. A finding is a bug only if it reproduces twice. Note the repro steps.

## Capture + Launch

- [x] Pre-commit / build sanity: app launches, HUD appears, no console errors on startup
- [x] Source selector opens and lists screens/windows with live thumbnails
- [x] Selecting a source works for **full screen**
- [x] Selecting a source works for a **single app window** (not just full screen — regression check for #60: confirm the recorded video is NOT a black screen, including a window with an odd-pixel client size if you can arrange one)
- [x] Record start/stop works from the HUD
- [x] **Stop reliably completes** with system audio/mic/webcam/cursor all *disabled* (regression check for #115: this combination used to hang indefinitely on Windows) — confirm the editor opens within a few seconds of clicking stop
- [x] Stop reliably completes with system audio + mic + webcam + cursor all *enabled* (no regression to the normal path)
- [ ] Tray icon "Stop Recording" works while recording (right-click → Stop, or left/double-click to refocus the HUD if it's minimized) — not exercised in the 2026-07-19 pass, worth covering next run
- [ ] Opening an existing video file works from the launch window — not exercised in the 2026-07-19 pass
- [x] Opening an existing project works from the launch window
- [x] **HUD drag tracks the cursor** with no drift, including a long drag across most of the screen (regression check for #100) — drag it, release, and confirm it doesn't jump afterward
- [ ] Countdown overlay (if enabled) shows before recording starts and doesn't block the source — not exercised in the 2026-07-19 pass

## Audio

- [x] Mic toggle on/off works before recording
- [x] Mic device selection (if multiple mics available) works
- [x] System audio toggle works — verify across **two separate recordings** (toggle state isn't sticky/stale between them)
- [ ] Mic-only recording produces audible mic audio on playback — only the combined mic+system-audio path was exercised this pass
- [ ] System-audio-only recording produces audible system audio on playback — only the combined path was exercised this pass
- [x] Mic + system audio together: both are audible and levels are reasonably balanced (not one drowning out the other)
- [x] **Exported video has audio** matching what was audible in the editor preview (regression check for #108: mic/system audio used to be silently dropped on export) — check this for at least one mic+system-audio recording

## Editor Load + Playback

- [x] Recording stop opens the editor automatically with the correct video (and webcam PiP, if recorded) loaded
- [x] Playback, pause, seek all work from the transport controls
- [x] **Playhead tracks actual video position with no visible lag**, including while dragging the playhead during playback (regression check for #111)
- [ ] Cursor telemetry overlay (highlight/spotlight, if enabled during capture) renders correctly and stays aligned with the actual cursor position throughout playback — cursor mode was inadvertently left on "editable cursor" rather than "highlight" during capture in the 2026-07-19 pass; re-run with highlight mode explicitly enabled

## Webcam / Full Camera

- [x] Webcam PiP renders during playback in the position/size/shape configured (rectangle vs. other mask shapes)
- [ ] Webcam mirroring toggle works — not exercised in the 2026-07-19 pass
- [ ] Webcam reactive zoom (PiP grows on cursor activity, if enabled) behaves reasonably — not exercised in the 2026-07-19 pass
- [x] **Full Camera segment**: press `C` (or the equivalent UI action) to add a Full Camera segment on the timeline; scrubbing through it grows the webcam to fullscreen with an ease-in, and eases back out at the segment's end

## Timeline

- [x] Add / edit / remove each element type: **zoom region**, **annotation**, **trim region**, **speed region** — confirm each behaves correctly in preview playback (speed region only added/removed, not scrubbed through)
- [ ] **Auto-zoom regions follow the cursor for their whole span**, not just a static frozen point at the start (regression check for #72) — only a *manual* zoom region was tested in the 2026-07-19 pass; auto-zoom itself was verified separately when #72 was fixed (see PR #118) but not re-run as part of this full pass
- [x] Region drag/resize snaps and persists correctly (re-open the project or scrub away and back to confirm the change stuck)
- [x] No overlap/ordering bugs on timeline items (annotations are the one type allowed to overlap by design — everything else should not silently collide)
- [x] Undo/redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z) works for at least one add/edit/remove action per element type
- [x] **Exported video matches the editor preview 1:1** for whatever combination of zoom/annotation/trim/speed/Full-Camera was added — this is the one item worth actually exporting and watching back, not just eyeballing the preview

## Project Persistence

- [x] Save works (explicit save action, if present, or auto-save)
- [x] Load works: close and reopen the project, confirm every timeline element, webcam settings, and style setting (wallpaper/padding/shadow/etc.) survived exactly as left — **found and fixed a bug**: the reloaded project's seekable duration was capped at the last element's end time rather than the true recording length (fixed in PR #127)

## Style / Other

- [x] Wallpaper, padding, shadow intensity, border radius, aspect ratio, motion blur sliders all visibly affect the preview when tweaked (padding and aspect ratio spot-checked directly; the rest render from the same panel and share the same binding pattern)
- [x] Blur / background-disable-adjacent settings (see #84) — confirmed padding=0 already achieves a full-bleed "no background" look with existing sliders; posted this back on #84 to clarify what the requester actually wants
- [x] Language switcher changes UI strings correctly (spot-check one non-English locale) — French spot-checked, thorough coverage including timeline element labels
- [x] Export completes for at least one full project combining several of the above (audio + zoom + Full Camera + trim), and the resulting file plays back correctly outside the app (e.g. in a system video player) — verified directly via `ffprobe`/`ffmpeg volumedetect`, not just visual inspection

## Windows-native specifics (if testing on Windows)

- [x] Software-encoder fallback notice (if the machine can't use hardware H.264) appears appropriately and doesn't block recording — not triggered in the 2026-07-19 pass (hardware encoder was used on this machine); correct absence, not a gap
- [x] Diagnostic bundle export (Settings → diagnostics, if present) completes without error

## macOS-native specifics (if testing on macOS)

- [ ] No crash immediately after stopping a recording (regression check for #21 — a known unresolved shutdown-path crash; if it reproduces, note the crash reporter output) — not testable, no macOS hardware available
- [ ] Recording survives an macOS Spaces switch while the HUD is visible — not testable, no macOS hardware available

## Results log

| Date | Build / commit tested | Tester | Findings |
|------|------------------------|--------|----------|
| 2026-07-19 | `release/v1.7.0` (post-#124 cherry-pick, pre-#125/#127) | Claude (computer-use) | 2 bugs found and fixed: (1) annotation placeholder text baked into content instead of being empty — PR #127; (2) post-reload duration capped at last element's end time — PR #127. Everything else checked above passed. Windows only; macOS section untestable without hardware. A few items (mic-only/system-audio-only isolation, webcam mirroring/reactive zoom, auto-zoom live re-verification, tray stop, countdown overlay, existing-video-file import) weren't exercised this pass and are called out inline above for next time. |
