// D-FS: `createDeepAgent` stacked a filesystem middleware, a todo middleware
// and a sub-agent middleware unconditionally, so the model was handed 25 tools
// instead of our 17 and a system message of ~8 700 characters instead of ours,
// promising a filesystem backed by an EMPTY in-memory store. Asked what cursor
// data the project holds, it ran `ls {"path":"/"}`, found nothing, and said so
// about the project. Counting the tools here is the cheapest tripwire for any
// dependency that starts injecting again.
//
// D-HONEST: every write was announced twice — once by the tool body with the
// executor's real verdict, once by the stream loop with `ok` hard-coded true —
// and read tools were announced only by the lying emission.
