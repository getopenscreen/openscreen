# Native capture helpers

## macOS

macOS native recording will use a ScreenCaptureKit helper with the same process boundary as the Windows WGC helper:

1. Electron resolves the selected source, output paths, and user-selected devices.
2. The helper receives one structured JSON request.
3. The helper owns ScreenCaptureKit/AVFoundation capture, timing, encoding, and muxing.
4. Electron persists the resulting media/session manifest and reports helper errors explicitly.

Helper locations:

1. `OPENSCREEN_SCK_CAPTURE_EXE`, for local development and diagnostics.
2. `electron/native/screencapturekit/build/openscreen-screencapturekit-helper`, for locally built Swift output.
3. `electron/native/bin/darwin-arm64/openscreen-screencapturekit-helper` or `electron/native/bin/darwin-x64/openscreen-screencapturekit-helper`, for packaged prebuilt helpers.

The macOS cursor-shape helper is resolved from `OPENSCREEN_MAC_CURSOR_HELPER_EXE` first, then the matching `openscreen-macos-cursor-helper` binary in the same local build and packaged `electron/native/bin/darwin-${arch}` directories.

Build the macOS helper with:

```bash
npm run build:native:mac
```

On non-macOS hosts this command exits successfully and does not affect Windows/Linux development. On macOS it builds the Swift package at `electron/native/screencapturekit`, writes the development binaries to `electron/native/screencapturekit/build`, and copies redistributable binaries to `electron/native/bin/darwin-${arch}`.

The current helper implementation supports display/window ScreenCaptureKit video capture, cursor exclusion through `SCStreamConfiguration.showsCursor`, H.264 encoding, MP4 muxing, and ScreenCaptureKit system audio. It also attempts native ScreenCaptureKit microphone capture when the running macOS version exposes that capability. Webcam recording currently stays as an Electron sidecar and is attached to the same recording session after the native screen capture stops.

Electron exposes `is-native-mac-capture-available` for capability probing. It resolves the same helper locations listed above and reports `missing-helper` until a Swift helper binary is present. When available, macOS recording routes screen/window capture through the native helper so editable cursor recordings do not bake the system cursor into the video. Cursor positions are sampled in Electron; when the cursor helper is available and Accessibility is granted, samples are also tagged with link/text cursor hints such as `pointer`.

See `docs/engineering/macos-native-recorder-roadmap.md` for the contract, rollout phases, and SSOT rules.

## Windows

Windows native recording is resolved from one of these locations:

1. `OPENSCREEN_WGC_CAPTURE_EXE`, for local development and diagnostics.
2. `electron/native/wgc-capture/build/wgc-capture.exe`, for a locally built Ninja helper.
3. `electron/native/wgc-capture/build/Release/wgc-capture.exe`, for a locally built multi-config helper.
4. `electron/native/bin/win32-x64/wgc-capture.exe` or `electron/native/bin/win32-arm64/wgc-capture.exe`, for packaged prebuilt helpers.

Build the Windows helper with:

```powershell
npm run build:native:win
```

The build writes the CMake output to `electron/native/wgc-capture/build/wgc-capture.exe` and copies the redistributable binary to `electron/native/bin/win32-x64/wgc-capture.exe`.

The helper contract is process-based: the app starts the process with one JSON argument and sends commands on stdin. `stop\n` finalizes the recording. During migration the helper prints both newline-delimited JSON events and the legacy text messages `Recording started` / `Recording stopped. Output path: <path>`.

Current V2 JSON shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "recordingId": 123,
  "sourceType": "display",
  "sourceId": "screen:0:0",
  "displayId": 1,
  "windowHandle": null,
  "outputPath": "C:\\path\\recording-123.mp4",
  "videoWidth": 1920,
  "videoHeight": 1080,
  "fps": 60,
  "preferSoftwareEncoder": false,
  "captureSystemAudio": false,
  "captureMic": false,
  "microphoneDeviceId": "default",
  "microphoneDeviceName": "Microphone (NVIDIA Broadcast)",
  "microphoneGain": 1.4,
  "webcamEnabled": true,
  "webcamDeviceId": "default",
  "webcamDeviceName": "Camera (NVIDIA Broadcast)",
  "webcamWidth": 1280,
  "webcamHeight": 720,
  "webcamFps": 30,
  "outputs": {
    "screenPath": "C:\\path\\recording-123.mp4"
  }
}
```

The current helper implementation supports display/window video capture, system audio loopback, selected-microphone capture, Media Foundation webcam capture, and a DirectShow webcam fallback for virtual cameras that are not exposed through Media Foundation. Webcam frames are currently composed into the primary MP4 as a bottom-right picture-in-picture overlay. Browser `deviceId` values do not always map to Media Foundation symbolic links or WASAPI endpoint IDs, so the renderer passes both browser IDs and user-visible device names. For microphones, the helper tries the requested WASAPI endpoint ID first, then resolves an active capture endpoint by `microphoneDeviceName`, then falls back to the default endpoint. For webcams, Electron resolves a matching DirectShow filter CLSID for the selected label; the helper uses Media Foundation first, then that exact DirectShow filter when the requested camera is absent from Media Foundation.

Encoder selection: by default the helper keeps the existing sink-writer path first. If that path fails while setting up H.264, it retries with the Microsoft software H.264 encoder (`mfh264enc.dll`). The key of this retry is registering that encoder locally in the helper process via `MFTRegisterLocalByCLSID`, which makes a software H.264 encoder available even when the machine's hardware encoders are missing or broken; hardware transforms are disabled for the retry only as a secondary guard so the sink writer prefers the locally registered software encoder, not as the fallback mechanism itself. Set `preferSoftwareEncoder: true` in the helper JSON, or set `OPENSCREEN_WGC_PREFER_SOFTWARE_ENCODER=true` before launching Electron, to force the software path from the first attempt.

The helper reports the outcome through the `encoder-selection` stdout event (`video` is `default`, `software-preferred`, or `software-fallback`). When the app sees `software-fallback` — the default encoder failed and the helper switched on its own — it shows a small dismissible notice in the recording HUD with a "Don't show again" option, because software encoding can raise CPU usage. An explicit `software-preferred` selection shows no notice, and the event stays available for diagnostics either way.

Encoder diagnostic on final sink-writer failure: when the final `MFCreateSinkWriterFromURL` attempt fails, the helper logs the registered H.264 video encoder MFT count (via `MFTEnumEx`), the registered AAC encoder count when audio was requested, and the hex HRESULT. If no H.264 encoder is registered, it additionally emits the four-bullet actionable error (missing Media Feature Pack / GPU driver registration / empty `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Transforms` / reboot). If an H.264 encoder IS registered but the sink writer still failed, it logs a hint pointing at invalid output path, missing MP4 mux, or GPU driver incompatibility. There is still no fail-fast pre-flight gate because `MFTEnumEx` and `MFCreateSinkWriterFromURL` can disagree about which H.264 encoders are available in non-interactive / Session 0 contexts.

Smoke-test the helper with:

```powershell
npm run test:wgc-helper:win
npm run test:wgc-helper:win -- --software-encoder
npm run test:wgc-helper:win -- --software-fallback
npm run test:wgc-window:win
npm run test:wgc-audio:win
npm run test:wgc-mic:win
npm run test:wgc-mixed-audio:win
npm run test:wgc-webcam:win
```

`--software-encoder` keeps testing the explicit `software-preferred` path with
`preferSoftwareEncoder: true`. `--software-fallback` keeps
`preferSoftwareEncoder: false` and sets
`OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_INJECT_DEFAULT_SINK_WRITER_FAILURE_ONCE=1` only for the helper
child process. At the first default/non-software `MFCreateSinkWriterFromURL` call, the
helper returns `HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND)` (`0x80070003`) exactly once.
The existing retry then performs the real local Microsoft software H.264 MFT registration,
creates the real fallback sink writer, captures and encodes real frames, and must report
`software-fallback`.

For a full-application test, set the same test-only variable before launching Electron and
remove it afterward:

```powershell
$env:OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_INJECT_DEFAULT_SINK_WRITER_FAILURE_ONCE = "1"
npm run dev
Remove-Item Env:OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_INJECT_DEFAULT_SINK_WRITER_FAILURE_ONCE
```

Only the exact value `1` enables this native test hook. It is not a preference or UI option,
and it is inert when absent. This is deterministic fault injection at the original
sink-writer failure boundary. It proves the application's automatic fallback behavior after
that controlled failure; it does **not** claim validation on a naturally affected machine
with a genuinely broken GPU driver or naturally missing hardware H.264 MFT.

To validate a specific native webcam manually:

```powershell
$env:OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_WEBCAM_DEVICE_NAME = "NVIDIA Broadcast"
npm run test:wgc-webcam:win
Remove-Item Env:OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_WEBCAM_DEVICE_NAME
```

To validate a specific native microphone manually:

```powershell
$env:OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_MICROPHONE_DEVICE_NAME = "Microphone (NVIDIA Broadcast)"
npm run test:wgc-mic:win
Remove-Item Env:OPENSCREEN_WGC_TEST_MICROPHONE_DEVICE_NAME
```
