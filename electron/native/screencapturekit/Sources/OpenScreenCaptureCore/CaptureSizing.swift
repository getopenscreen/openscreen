/// How big the ScreenCaptureKit output buffer has to be, given the content the stream will
/// actually rasterise.
///
/// # Why this is not "the size of the display"
///
/// `SCStreamConfiguration.width`/`height` are **pixels**, and ScreenCaptureKit will not
/// enlarge a smaller source to fill them. `scalesToFit` defaults to `false`, and the SDK
/// header is explicit about what that means: *"When true, the output scales up and down. When
/// false, the output only scales down."* Configure a buffer bigger than the source and the
/// frame is drawn at its native size in one corner of it, with the background — black —
/// everywhere else. The recording is then a small picture inside a large black rectangle, at
/// full file resolution, for its entire duration (issue #418).
///
/// The size the stream rasterises is a property of the `SCContentFilter`: its `contentRect`
/// (points) times its `pointPixelScale`. That product is the only correct value for
/// `width`/`height`. A display size read from CoreGraphics is not: `CGDisplayPixelsWide` is
/// documented in "pixel units" but tracks the display *mode*, so on a Retina Mac it can report
/// a number that is neither what the filter measures nor what the stream draws — and nothing
/// downstream reconciles the two. On a 1× display the two agree, which is exactly why this
/// only ever showed up on HiDPI machines.
///
/// # Why the cap is proportional
///
/// The caller carries a ceiling (the app asks for at most 4K). Clamping each axis on its own
/// changes the *shape* of the buffer, and a buffer whose aspect ratio differs from the source
/// hits the same wall from the other side: `scalesToFit == false` still scales down, but it
/// preserves aspect, so the surplus becomes black bars. A 5120×1440 ultrawide capped to
/// 3840×1440 per axis is drawn as 3840×1080 with 180 black rows above and below it. Scaling
/// both axes by one factor keeps the buffer the same shape as the source, so the downscale
/// fills it.
///

///   - contentSize: `SCContentFilter.contentRect.size` — the captured region, in points.

///   - maxHeight: Ceiling for the returned height, in pixels.
