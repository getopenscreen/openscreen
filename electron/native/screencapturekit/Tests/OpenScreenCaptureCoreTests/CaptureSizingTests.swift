	/// region is 1512×949 points at 2×. The buffer has to be the full 3024×1898 — but it has to
	/// be that because the *filter* says so, not because a display API happened to agree.
	///
	/// The regression this pins is the other direction: a buffer of 3024×1898 around content
	/// ScreenCaptureKit rasterises at 1512×949 puts the whole desktop in one corner of a black
