 * a parent that gave up first would kill a working save.
 *
 * It must stay above the helper's own shutdown ceiling
 * (`OPENSCREEN_WGC_STOP_BUDGET_MS`, 50s — see the stop sequence in
 * `electron/native/wgc-capture/src/main.cpp`), which is what guarantees the
 * helper always ends itself rather than being killed mid-finalize from here.
 * Raise one and raise the other.
 *
 * What changed for issue #252 is that reaching this timeout is no longer how a
 * wedged recorder is caught: the helper bounds every shutdown step itself and
 * force-exits within seconds, so 'close' arrives long before this fires.
 * Getting here means the helper is stuck somewhere even `TerminateProcess`
 * could not reach.
