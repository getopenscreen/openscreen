    # `importCargoLock` fetched every crate from
    # `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>/<version>/download`, which crates.io
    # now answers with 403 — it rate-limits that endpoint to 1 req/s and points
    # clients at the CDN instead (rust-lang/crates.io#13482). Every crate in the
    # lockfile failed, so `nix build` died in `cargo-vendor-dir` before reaching a
    # single derivation of ours: `Nix build` was red on main from 2026-08-30, and
    # since `nix-check.yml` only compares npmDepsHash and `nix-build.yml` did not
    # run on pull requests, the derivation itself was not being built anywhere --
    # not before a merge, and not after one either while this was red.
    # d2f6794 carries the switch to `https://static.crates.io/crates`.
