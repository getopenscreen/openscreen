// electron-builder beforePack hook: refuse to package a compositor addon that is older than its
// Rust sources.
//
// `compositor_view.node` is an untracked build artifact, and plain `npm run build` does NOT rebuild
// it (only `build:win` runs `build:native:compositor`). So a bare `npm run build` — or a fresh
// worktree that inherited a copy from the main checkout — happily ships a `.node` built from
// whatever the sources looked like days ago.
//
// That failure is silent, which is what makes it worth a hard error. Scene fields the app sends are
// `#[serde(default)]` on the Rust side, so an addon predating a contract change does not reject the
// payload: it ignores the unknown key, takes the default, and falls back to older art. The feature
// simply does nothing, with no error in any log — it reads exactly like a bug in the TypeScript, and
// it has already cost one full false-trail investigation (custom cursor themes, 2026-07-27, where
// the shipped addon was 3 days older than the commit adding `cursorSprites`).
//
// ponytail: mtime comparison, not content hashing. A `git checkout` restamps source mtimes, so this
// can fire when the addon is actually fine. That trade is deliberate — the false positive costs one
// rebuild, the false negative ships a broken installer. Switch to hashing the sources into a stamp
// file next to the `.node` if branch-switching makes the noise annoying.
