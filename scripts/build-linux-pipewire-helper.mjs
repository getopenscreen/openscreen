// Builds the Linux cursor/capture helper (electron/native/pipewire-capture) and
// vendors it to electron/native/bin/linux-<arch>/, the folder
// pipeWireCursorRecordingSession.ts resolves at runtime.
//
// The Linux counterpart of build-macos-screencapturekit-helper.mjs and
// build-windows-wgc-helper.mjs.
//
// PIPEWIRE needs no pkg-config and no dev package: the C shim compiles against
// headers vendored in the repo and resolves libpipewire with dlopen at runtime.
// That is the point — libpipewire-0.3-dev is not installed on a stock Ubuntu,
// and requiring it would gate the whole Linux build on a package the base
// system does not ship.
//
// FFMPEG is different, and has been since the helper started encoding H.264.
// It is linked normally, its libraries are staged next to the binary by
// stageFfmpeg() below, and the RUNPATH points at them. Unlike the compositor
// addon there is no symbol renaming: the helper is a separate PROCESS, so
// Chromium's libffmpeg.so is never in its address space and cannot collide.
// See its Cargo.toml.
//
// The crate is NOT part of the crates/ workspace (see its Cargo.toml for why),
// so it is built by pointing cargo at its own manifest.
