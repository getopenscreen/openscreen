// Guards the macOS deployment floor of the native Swift helpers (issue #515).
//
// The floor is declared in THREE places that must agree: `mac.minimumSystemVersion` in
// electron-builder.json5 (what the .app tells LaunchServices), the README's system
// requirements (what we promise), and the `platforms:` block in Package.swift (what the
// helpers are actually built for). This file ties the third to the first.
//
// The direction matters. Package.swift may not declare a floor HIGHER than the app
// advertises — that is exactly #515: the floor here was set to 13 when ScreenCaptureKit
// was the only target, openscreen-macos-cursor-helper was added later and inherited it
// because SwiftPM has no per-target override, and the bundle went on advertising macOS 12
// (Electron's own LSMinimumSystemVersion, inherited because the key was unset).
//
// The damage was not the version number. At a deployment target >= 13 the linker resolves
// the Swift Foundation overlay symbols against Foundation.framework and drops
// /usr/lib/swift/libswiftFoundation.dylib from the load commands; on macOS 12 those
// symbols live only in that dylib, so the helper died in the loader before it could speak
// — and the app reported that as a denied Accessibility grant.
//
// A text assertion rather than a build: this has to fail on Linux and Windows CI too,
// where no Swift toolchain exists.
