// Provisions the ONNX Runtime shared library into
// electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/, next to the compositor addon and the
// ffmpeg libraries. That directory is gitignored and shipped by electron-builder's
// extraResources, so this runs at build time rather than committing a 15-38 MB binary.
//
// WHY IT SHIPS: the native compositor segments the webcam subject on the CPU
// execution provider (crates/compositor/src/segmentation.rs), and `ort` is linked
// with `load-dynamic` — nothing is needed to BUILD, but at runtime
// `ensureOnnxRuntimeOnPath` (electron/native-bridge/services/compositorViewService.ts)
// walks this exact directory looking for the library and sets ORT_DYLIB_PATH to it.
// Without it `Segmenter::load` fails, the compositor logs one line and draws the
// webcam unsegmented — so the AI background cutout/blur/custom modes are simply off.
// Everything degrades; nothing breaks. That is why this script never fails a build.
//
// VERSION IS NOT FREE TO MOVE. crates/Cargo.toml pins `ort` with feature `api-NN`,
// which is the MINIMUM ONNX Runtime minor version the crate will accept — a lower
// one makes `GetApi` return null and `ort` panics rather than erroring. The pin here
// must satisfy that, and scripts/fetch-onnxruntime.test.mjs cross-checks the two so
// a bump on either side cannot land alone.
//
// SUPPLY CHAIN. This binary is signed and shipped to every user, so nothing floats:
//   - Pinned to an immutable release tag, never `latest`.
//   - SHA-256 verified before the archive is opened. The digests below are the ones
//     GitHub publishes per asset (`digest` in the releases API), independently
//     re-verified by downloading and hashing.
//   - Only the plain CPU assets. The `gpu_cuda*` variants are 200-320 MB and pull
//     NVIDIA runtime dependencies we neither need nor may redistribute; the measured
//     decision to use the CPU EP is in
//     technical-documentation/engineering/webcam-segmentation.md.
//
// LICENSING: ONNX Runtime is MIT, which is compatible with this MIT app — but the
// archive is checked rather than trusted, the same way fetch-ffmpeg.mjs verifies
// ffmpeg's LGPL-ness instead of believing the asset name. Attribution ships in
// THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.
