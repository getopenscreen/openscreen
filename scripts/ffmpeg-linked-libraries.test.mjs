// `crates/compositor/build.rs` decides which ffmpeg shared libraries the native addon
// imports. Six places have to agree with that list, and none of them is derived from it:
//
//   - scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs      vendors the Windows DLLs and decides when to skip
//   - scripts/before-pack.cjs       fails the pack if one is missing (three OS tables)
//   - scripts/build-linux-compositor-addon.mjs  copies + symbol-renames the sonames
//   - nix/compositor-view.nix       builds symbols.map from a brace glob
//
// Drift is not a cosmetic problem. The addon is a cdylib, so a missing library does not
// fail the link: it fails at `require()` with "undefined symbol: osff_avfilter_graph_alloc",
// `compositorViewService` logs "native addon not present; running as no-op", and the app
// ships with a blank preview and every export dead — the exact symptom 1.9.0 shipped with.
// Every guard listed above passes in that state, because each one only knows the list it
// was written with.
//
// This test derives the truth from build.rs and checks the other five against it, so
// linking a seventh library fails here instead of in a user's installer. It reads source
// text: before-pack.cjs and fetch-ffmpeg.mjs both do work at import time, and the property
// under test is a property of the literal lists anyway.
//
// The nix derivation is the reason this file exists rather than an assertion inside
// before-pack.test.mjs: `.github/workflows/nix-build.yml` does not run on pull requests
// and there is no nix on the Windows dev box, so nix/compositor-view.nix reaches main with
// no pre-merge signal at all. A text assertion is not `nix build`, but it does catch the
// one mistake that has actually happened.
