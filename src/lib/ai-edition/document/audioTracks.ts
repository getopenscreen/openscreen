// Placement and payload edits for timeline audio tracks (issue #350).
//
// Audio tracks are CLIP-ANCHORED, so unlike the array-only ops this module used
// to hold, placement goes through the shared pill helpers in
// `timeline/timelineMap.ts` — the same machinery zoom, annotation, speed and
// camera-fullscreen regions already use. One user-visible track is one PILL;
// underneath it is one anchored fragment per clip it covers.
//
// The one thing audio needs that no other region kind does is `offsetMs`
// advancement. `anchorRawRegionsToClips` copies a region's payload verbatim
// into every fragment, which is right for value-per-span effects (both halves
// of a split zoom are still "depth 3") and wrong for continuous media: two
// fragments each carrying `offsetMs: 2000` would both restart the file two
// seconds in, so a bed spanning a cut audibly restarts at the boundary, and
// each fragment would re-run the layer's fades. `anchorAudioTrackFragments`
// fixes the payload up afterwards: every fragment's `offsetMs` is advanced by
// the source time its predecessors consumed, and the fades are kept on the
// outer edges only.
