// An insertion IS a clip.
//
// A word typed into the transcript cuts its clip in two and puts a generated clip between
// the halves:
//
//     [ recording 0→5.3 ]  [ generated 0→0.4 ]  [ recording 5.3→20.9 ]
//
// Stored exactly as it reads. Nothing downstream carries a notion of an insertion: every
// mapping in this codebase rests on "a clip is an uninterrupted shift between its source
// seconds and the ruler", and three clips satisfy that where one interrupted clip satisfied
// none of them. The generated clip is then a clip like any other — it can be moved, cropped,
// edited and deleted from the timeline, with no code of its own for any of it.
//
// It owns its word: the asset is `ext:<wordId>`, the file is named by the pair, and the
// transcript holds that one word at 0→duration. So the pane, the captions, the cue highlight
// and the exporter all read it through the paths they already had.
//
// Deleting is the exact inverse, and it is not spelled out here: `removeClip` is the single
// mutator for taking a clip away, and it rejoins contiguous survivors. Both delete paths —
// the transcript pane and the timeline — therefore put the clip back together for free.
