// React binding over the editor-settings pure module.
//
// Usage:
//   const { settings, set, setLive } = useEditorSettings();
//   - `settings` is a typed snapshot of the document's legacy settings.
//   - `set(patch)` writes + commits to disk (use for toggles, selects, on
//     slider release).
//   - `setLive(patch)` writes only (use while dragging a slider for the
//     preview to update without round-tripping every pixel).
//
// The hook is intentionally thin: it reads from the project store, applies
// the patch through `patchEditorSettings`, and persists via the store. No
// extra state, no caches — the document is the single source of truth.

	// annotations can carry base64 image data URLs. What the pin is worth, since a
	// count is easy to get wrong here: ten components call `useEditorSettings()`, at
	// most FIVE are mounted together (`PreviewCanvas` with `VirtualPreview` and
	// `WebcamOverlay` inside it, `V4Timeline`, and one inspector body), and of those
	// only two can ever fill these refs, because only `PreviewCanvas` and the pane the
	// inspector is showing call `setLive` -- the five `RightPanes` exports are
	// `FacetBody`'s mutually exclusive branches, so one at a time. Two instances, two
	// documents each.
	//
	// Release them when the project changes, which is the guard `useTimeline` carries,
	// keyed on the same thing, for the same reason -- and its two drag commits carry
	// the identity test below too, so the pair is symmetric in shape. It is not
	// symmetric in what a stale snapshot COSTS: `commitZoomFocus` and
	// `commitAnnotationChange` also write theirs back into the store when the save
	// fails, so a stale one there is a DOCUMENT and silently drops every edit since.
	// This hook has no rollback path, so the same staleness costs a history step and
	// nothing else.
	//
	// What this effect is NOT is the reason a snapshot of the project the user left
	// cannot reach the undo stack: `commit` below decides that, and decides it for a
	// project that never changed too.
	// biome-ignore lint/correctness/useExhaustiveDependencies: projectId is the trigger, not a read — the body only clears refs.

		// that never committed left behind, and every recording write since has already
		// put the states in between on the stack: handing that base on made one Ctrl+Z
