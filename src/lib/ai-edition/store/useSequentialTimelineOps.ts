// ponytail: serialise timeline-edit saves so two rapid calls don't race
// each other's save and overwrite one another in the store. The previous
// in-component implementation in NewEditorShell.tsx had a subtle race
// where the doc was read SYNCHRONOUSLY at call time but the save was
// serialised; two concurrent calls would both read the same pre-edit
// doc and the second save would clobber the first edit. The fix is to
// read the doc INSIDE the chain, after awaiting the previous save, so
// every call sees the doc state the previous call committed.
//
// A failed save resolves to null rather than rejecting -- `projectStore.saveDocument`
// reports it to the user and returns false. Operation and dynamic-import errors still
// reject the promise handed to the caller; both call sites `void` it, so those remain
// unhandled rejections. They are also the two failures that mean the code is broken
// rather than the disk, so they belong in the console.
//
// The chain is exposed as `enqueue` as well as `apply`, because the race
// belongs to the DOCUMENT, not to AxcutTimelineOperation: every timeline
// edit is a read-modify-write of the whole document, so a mutation that
// serialises on its own second queue still clobbers one running on this
// one. `insertClipAt` is the case in point — it can't be expressed as an
// operation, since it carries a background duration probe, but it has to
// share the queue with the ops. Anything that reads the doc and saves it
// back belongs here.
//
// Errors are swallowed when advancing the queue ref so a failed save
// doesn't poison the queue (the next call still has a resolved promise
// to chain off). The original promise returned to the caller is NOT
// swallowed — the caller can await it and observe the rejection.
