// What an insertion is made of: a duration, a name, and a file.
//
// An insertion IS a clip (see `document/insertion.ts`), so there is nothing here that maps
// between coordinate systems and nothing downstream that knows an insertion exists. What
// remains is the handful of rules the writer and the generator both have to agree on — how
// long an added word takes, what its asset is called, and where its file lives — expressed
// once so the renderer names the file the main process writes.
