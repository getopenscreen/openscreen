// One answer to "is this raw ruler moment in the film" (issue #560).
//
// Everything that reads the timeline used to answer that question its own way, and the
// answers disagreed. The transcript pane asked it by IDENTITY — does a trim name this
// clip — which is a question a voiceover placement can never answer yes to, since it
// carries an audio fragment id and an audio asset while every trim carries a video clip.
// So the voiceover lane read every word as kept, including words whose moment had been
// cut out of the film, and a cut authored from that lane removed nothing at all.
//
// The fix is not a better identity test. It is to stop asking about identity: a trim is a
// removed span of the RAW RULER, and both lanes lie on that one ruler. A word — from the
// recording or from a voiceover — is removed if and only if the raw moment it occupies is.
//
// `keptRawSpans` is therefore lifted verbatim out of `projectRawTimelineSecToPlayback`,
// which now calls it, rather than reimplemented beside it. Agreement with playback is by
// construction; `programme-time.test.ts` holds the two to it on randomised fixtures.
//
// Storage does not change: a trim stays source-time anchored to a clip. This is the
// derived READING of those rows, computed on demand and never written back.
