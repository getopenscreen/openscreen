//                rejoined, …) is irrelevant: identity is what a region IS, never where
//                it came from or how it got there.
//   2. REPEL   — two regions of the same kind with DIFFERENT identities may not
//                overlap. An edit clamps to the neighbour's edge; the neighbour never
//                moves (no cascade).
//
// A kind with no properties (trim, full-camera) collapses to a constant identity, so
// its regions always merge — the long-standing trim behaviour, now *derived* from the

 *    is read straight off the anchor and intersected with the kept segments of that
 *    clip. This is the SSOT path — it never consults `startMs`/`endMs` nor raw-virtual
 *    time, so a stale derived cache or a shifted ruler layout cannot move the region.
 *  - **unanchored**: the legacy raw→source mapping through each segment's own raw
 *    extent, kept because migration deliberately preserves un-anchorable regions.
 *
 * In both paths a region split across two kept segments by a trim yields one entry per
 * segment (fresh id for the extra copies, original id on the first).
 *
 * A region overlapping no visible segment lies entirely under a trim: it is emitted ONCE,
 * marked `underTrim`, on its own source span and borrowing the `clipIndex` of the kept
 * segment the cut interrupts (`cutAddressingSegmentIndex`). It is deliberately NOT
 * dropped: a trim is marked by its pill and skipped during playback, but a user who
 * moves the playhead onto it themselves should see what is underneath rather than the
 * next segment's first frame — the modifiers included (issue #216). What makes that safe
 * is the borrowed `clipIndex`: the naive fix re-emitted the region with its RAW-virtual ms
 * and NO clipIndex, and native's `belongs()` (scene.rs) accepts a clipIndex-less region on
 * ANY clip whose source window numerically overlaps those raw numbers — so the effect
 * fired later on an unrelated clip (the same wrong-clip class as the `speed_at` fix in
 * regions.rs). An index pins it to one clip, and `underTrim` is what tells native to gate
 * it hard on its own span so a zoom's ease-in cannot bleed into the kept frames next to
 * the cut — the render still cuts, exactly as it did.
 *
 * A region whose clip has no kept segment at all still has nothing to address it with, and
 * is dropped. With no segments AT ALL there is no layout to resolve against, so the
 * historical clipIndex-less passthrough stays for that degenerate case (it reaches an empty
 * native clip list and so can never be matched anyway).
 *
 * `visibleSegments` MUST be the same array (same order) serialized to `Scene.clips` so
 * the emitted `clipIndex` lines up with the native stream; `rawClips` is

 * Resolve a RAW timeline playhead to the active native clip's screen-source clock.

 * The playhead (`currentTimeSec`) lives on the RAW ruler (trims still occupy their
 * space); the native compositor plays the trim-COMPRESSED `visibleSegments`. This
 * maps raw→source through each segment's OWN raw extent (via `rawClips`, the
 * un-compressed layout) so the source time is correct after a trim, and returns
 * the segment's `clipIndex` in the compressed stream so `setActiveClip`/`presentTime`
 * address the right decoder + the right paired camera. Returns null only when there are
 * no segments at all. Replaces `nativePlaybackPosition.resolveNativePlaybackPosition`,
 * which conflated the raw and compressed layouts (correct only without trims).
 *
 * Over a trimmed-out stretch it presents THE FRAME THAT IS ACTUALLY THERE: the trim keeps
 * its place on the raw ruler, so the playhead names a real source moment, and the decoder
 * holds the whole recording — only the kept WINDOW was narrowed. It used to snap to the
 * next kept segment's first frame instead, which meant the ruler said one thing and the
 * preview showed another; a modifier under the cut would then have been incrusted on a
 * frame that is not its own (issue #216). Playback is untouched: it never lets the playhead
 * linger in a cut, and native free-runs past `source_end_sec` on its own. The segment it
 * borrows for `clipIndex` is `cutAddressingSegmentIndex` — the SAME one the modifiers under
 * that cut borrow, or `belongs()` would filter them out.
