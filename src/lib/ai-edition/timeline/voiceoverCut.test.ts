// Issue #560, step 4. A cut authored from the voiceover lane used to be anchored on an
// AUDIO FRAGMENT — `resolvePlaybackSegments` matched nothing for it, so the word turned
// red and the film, the preview and the export were all unchanged. A silent lie.
//
// The pane now emits a RAW span and the write site resolves the clips under it. These pin
// the arithmetic that does it; the pane's own clamp is pinned in TranscriptPane.lanes.
