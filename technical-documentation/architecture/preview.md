# Preview

The preview is the editor's frame-at-the-playhead surface. It is composited by the same
Rust + Direct3D 11 native crate that drives MP4 export — `crates/compositor/` reached via the
`compositor_view.node` napi-rs addon — and pulled into the renderer as an RGBA8
bitmap that paints onto an HTML `<canvas>`. The DOM around the canvas hosts the
interactive-only layers (zoom gimbal, annotation selection, PiP webcam drag) that
need real hitboxes. Everything visible in the preview comes out of the same
compositor that writes the export; parity is the property of one renderer, not a
discipline across two.

This document describes the live composition path. The export pipe
([architecture/export-pipeline.md](export-pipeline.md)) shares the same compositor
and scene contract; the GPU-resident path it builds on is documented in
[architecture/native-compositor.md](native-compositor.md). Performance numbers
(preview fluidity, bench methodology, the trade-offs that drove this design) live
in [engineering/rendering-performance.md](../engineering/rendering-performance.md).

## The compositor path

One compositor exists in the source tree, and it is the live one. A Pixi/WebGL
single-canvas screen compositor was tried alongside it and removed once it was
established that nothing mounted it.

### Native D3D compositor overlay (live)

Mounted as the first child of `.previewFrame` by
[`NativeCompositorOverlay.tsx`](../../src/components/ai-edition/NativeCompositorOverlay.tsx).
It owns the `<canvas>`, drives a `useNativeCompositorView` hook that allocates an
offscreen `compositor_view` view sized to the canvas's device-pixel rect
([`useNativeCompositorView.ts:73`](../../src/native/hooks/useNativeCompositorView.ts:73)),
and pushes a `SceneDescription` JSON every time the document or the editor
settings change. Wallpaper, screen video, webcam, cursor, zoom regions, annotations
— every visible pixel comes from this view. The DOM neighbours it (the `.screenStage`
wrapper, the screen `<video>`, the `WebcamOverlay` `<video>`, the `AnnotationLayer`, the
`ZoomFocusOverlay`, the webcam drag hitbox) are *interactive overlays*: their pixels are
hidden in CSS, only their pointer-event geometry counts.

The two `<video>` elements decode no picture either. The screen `<video>` is the playback
clock, and an `<audio>` on the same file plays its sound; both deselect their video track
once their metadata is in (`dropVideoTrack`, under the `AudioVideoTracks` Blink feature the
editor window enables). Left alone, each decoded the whole recording a second and a third
time beside the compositor: ~6.7 % of an RTX 4070 Ti's decode engine apiece on a 1080p60
take, measured, and zero once the track is dropped, with the clock, `playbackRate` and seeks
unchanged. A recording without sound keeps its picture: with neither track selected the
element has nothing left to keep time with and races to its end. The `WebcamOverlay`
`<video>` is never played at all — it is read for the camera's size (`loadedmetadata`),
which shapes the PiP box in the scene.

The path is enabled by the *presence of the native addon* — there is no flag,
no capability probe, no per-document switch. The compositing service loads
`compositor_view.node` at startup via
[`compositorViewService.ts`](../../electron/native-bridge/services/compositorViewService.ts:271)
(`ensureAddon`); when the binary is missing the service logs once
(`[compositor-view] native addon not present; running as no-op`,
[`compositorViewService.ts:288`](../../electron/native-bridge/services/compositorViewService.ts:288))
and returns synthetic negative view ids whose `readFrame` always returns `null`, so
the whole overlay stays inert. In that mode the renderer's own `<video>` element
keeps playing (decode is the responsibility of the DOM, not the compositor), but
nothing composites a frame — the canvas stays empty. The editor ships like this
on platforms where the addon isn't built; the dev build brings the addon in.

The renderer→addon IPC goes through `native-bridge:invoke` with a single
`compositor` domain
([`compositorViewClient.ts:24`](../../src/native/compositorViewClient.ts:24)). The
service in the main process loads the addon from
`electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/compositor_view.node` (packaged) or
`electron/native/compositor-view/build/compositor_view.node` (dev), with an
`OPENSCREEN_COMPOSITOR_VIEW_NODE` env override for the standalone builds. The
ffmpeg shared-DLL directory is prepended to `PATH` before the require so the
addon's `LoadLibrary("avcodec-NN.dll")` resolves against the same pinned build the
crate links against
([`compositorViewService.ts:206`](../../electron/native-bridge/services/compositorViewService.ts:206)).

There is no fallback to a CPU/Canvas2D legacy compositor: before the native view
ships a frame, only the wallpaper painted by CSS is visible, and the cursor / zoom
DOM layers depend on the layout math (not the compositor) to know where to land.
That is a product gap, not a fallback path. The native preview is the only
compositor in service.

## Scene description

`document → SceneDescription → JSON` is the contract the app hands the native
compositor so it can compute the composed frame itself; the renderer does no
per-frame math.

[`buildSceneDescription`](../../src/native/sceneDescription.ts:419)
(`src/native/sceneDescription.ts`) is a pure data mapping from an `AxcutDocument` plus the
current editor settings to a `SceneDescription` JSON string. It resolves:

- **Visible clips.** [`resolveVisibleClips`](../../src/native/sceneDescription.ts:411)
  is the single shared clip list: `resolvePlaybackSegments(document.timeline.clips, document.timeline.trimRanges)`
  (trim-narrowed, so word-level cuts from the transcript editor actually reach the
  compositor instead of only affecting the transcript panel's own strikethrough)
  sorted by `timelineStartSec` and filtered to clips whose asset has a resolvable
  `originalPath`. The same call backs `buildSceneDescription`, the native-export
  clip list in `ExportDialog`, and the active-clip lookup in
  `NativeCompositorOverlay` — three previously-divergent sites that are now the
  same expression.
- **Scene regions.** Zoom, Full Camera, speed, annotations, and captions are stored
  in *RAW document* time (trims still occupy their place) but applied at each
  frame's *source time* (the compositor matches each decoded frame's PTS, not a
  timeline counter). [`projectRegionsToSource`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/timelineMap.ts)
  bridges the two reference frames by resolving each region against every visible
  segment's own raw extent and emitting one entry per source-time span it covers,
  tagged with the segment's `clipIndex`. Captions piggyback on annotations
  (`captionCuesToTextRegions` produces text annotations at the same zIndex layer)
  so the compositor draws them with the same path; deliberately no separate
  caption layer in the native code.
- **Layout.** The webcam rect is resolved by the same
  [`computeCompositeLayout`](../../src/lib/compositeLayout.ts) call the legacy
  `frameRenderer` runs and shipped to the addon as `layout.webcamRect` /
  `layout.screenRect` in fractions of the output frame. The native side consumes
  those verbatim and applies the padding-slider and reactive-zoom adjustments on
  top, so preview/export never disagree on placement. Per-clip screen resolutions
  and crops mean a multi-clip document that mixes recording shapes (e.g. a 16:9
  screen crop clipped to 9:16 beside another native 9:16 clip) lays out exactly
  like a single recorded ratio; `layout.layoutByClip` is index-aligned with
  `clips` and `cropByClip` and the Rust `for_clip_window` selects the entry for
  the clip being composed.
- **Lengths as fractions.** Every length that crosses the contract is a fraction
  of its own reference box — `roundnessFrac` of the output frame's short side,
  `screenRadiusFrac` of the screen box's short side, annotation `x/y/w/h` of the
  screen rect, `padding` 0..1. There are no render-target pixels in the payload:
  the native compositor rasterises the preview into a small contain-fitted frame
  and the export at full output size, so a pixel meant two different things on
  the two sides of the boundary; a fraction has no unit to get wrong. The slider
  itself stays in pixels for the user — the division happens once, here.

The descriptor mirrors the Rust struct in
[`crates/compositor/src/scene.rs`](../../crates/compositor/src/scene.rs); field rename is `camelCase`
on both sides. The Rust consumer (`compositor.rs::compose_frame`,
[`crates/compositor/src/compositor.rs:1421`](../../crates/compositor/src/compositor_windows.rs:1421)) reads
the JSON per frame, derives the per-clip and per-frame values it needs (zoom
state from `regions.rs::zoom_state_at`, camera-fullscreen progress from
`regions.rs::camera_fullscreen_progress_at`, screen crop from
`SceneCrop::belongs`), and only then issues GPU draw calls. Region visibility is
expressed as `[startSec, endSec)` intervals and matched against `t = source_time`;
a region straddling a clip boundary emits one entry per covered clip via
`projectRegionsToSource`.

## Frame delivery

The native compositor runs *off-screen* (no OS window, no HWND ever crosses
IPC), and the renderer pulls composed frames out of it. The protocol is the load-bearing
contract between the two:

```ts
readFrame(id: number, sinceGen: number): { gen, width, height, data } | null
```

(`addons.d.ts` declares it as `CompositorViewAddon.readFrame`,
[`electron/native/compositor-view/addon.d.ts:93`](../../electron/native/compositor-view/addon.d.ts:93);
the renderer-facing type is `CompositorFramePacket`,
[`contracts.ts:120`](../../src/native/contracts.ts:120).)

The contract, with the invariant on the consumer side:

1. **Self-describing packet.** A returned object carries its own
   `width`/`height`/`data`. The drawing buffer is resized to those values
   *before* `putImageData` runs
   ([`useNativeCompositorView.ts:195`](../../src/native/hooks/useNativeCompositorView.ts:195)),
   so pixels and canvas can never drift apart: there is no separate source of
   truth for "how big the bitmap is right now" — every packet carries it.
2. **Generation-gated.** `gen` is a monotonic per-frame generation (≥ 1). The
   renderer holds the last one it painted and passes it back as `sinceGen`; the
   addon returns `null` whenever `gen <= sinceGen`. An idle preview pays
   nothing: no buffer clone, no IPC crossing, no canvas copy, no `putImageData`.
   The null return is the dominant case while the preview sits still (paused
   editing). One in-flight `readFrame` at a time
   ([`useNativeCompositorView.ts:155`](../../src/native/hooks/useNativeCompositorView.ts:155))
   so two responses can't land out of order and rewind `lastGen`.
3. **`data` is RGBA8, `width * height * 4` bytes.** The renderer wraps it via
   `new Uint8ClampedArray(data.buffer, data.byteOffset, data.byteLength)` —
   `ImageData` rejects `SharedArrayBuffer`-backed arrays, and the IPC binary is
   never shared, so the cast is safe. `createImageBitmap` decodes off the main
   thread (UI stays at 60/120 Hz) and snapshots the view, then `putImageData` is
   the synchronous fallback if bitmap creation is unavailable.
4. **Verify before trusting.** `data.byteLength !== width * height * 4 || width === 0 || height === 0`
   is a hard bail
   ([`useNativeCompositorView.ts:190`](../../src/native/hooks/useNativeCompositorView.ts:190)):
   a mismatch would corrupt the image silently. The consumer never assumes a
   size — every draw is preceded by a resize of the canvas's drawing buffer to
   the packet's declared `width`/`height`.
5. **Pull loop cadence.** Read-back frames are pulled on every other rAF tick
   (`PULL_LOOP_TICK_DIVISOR = 2`), shared-texture frames (below) on every tick. Each
   read-back frame is a GPU readback, a structured clone across IPC and a canvas upload,
   and the tick counter does not advance while a read is in flight: an 8 MB frame whose
   round trip passes 16.7 ms is pulled one tick in three, about 20 fps.

The renderer-side wrapper mirrors this verbatim in the Electron main process
([`compositorViewService.ts`](../../electron/native-bridge/services/compositorViewService.ts)),
so when the addon is absent the IPC layer returns `null` too — the renderer
never has to special-case "addon missing".

### Shared textures (Windows)

On Windows' hardware backend the pixels never leave the GPU. Copying them through RAM
was the preview's bottleneck, not the compositor: at the same ~57 composed frames per
second, read-back reached the canvas at 20-26 fps and kept 54-57 % of the renderer's main
thread busy (measurements in
[engineering/rendering-performance.md](../engineering/rendering-performance.md#preview-transport--2026-10-02)).

- **Native side.** The render thread copies each composed frame into one of four shared
  D3D11 textures (`shared_frames.rs`, NT handles, no keyed mutex), waits for the GPU to
  finish the copy, and publishes `{ gen, slot, handle }`. `SlotBook` tracks which slot
  holds the ready frame and which ones Chromium still holds; a frame nobody took gives
  its slot back. A held slot is never rewritten, since Chromium may still read it: when
  every slot is held and one has waited 1 s for its release, the view falls back to
  read-back.
- **Main process.** `readFrame` takes the frame (`readSharedFrame`), imports it with
  `sharedTexture.importSharedTexture`, sends it with `sharedTexture.sendSharedTexture` to
  the frame that asked, drops its own reference and answers with a receipt
  (`{ …meta, shared: true }`, no pixels). `allReferencesReleased` returns the slot
  (`releaseSharedFrame(id, slot, gen)`) once Chromium is done with it in every process.
- **Renderer.** The preload's `setSharedTextureReceiver` hands the frame to
  `electronAPI.onCompositorFrame`, ahead of the receipt; the hook draws the `VideoFrame`
  with `drawImage` and closes it. The pixels are byte-identical to read-back.
- **Fallbacks, all to read-back.** Not Windows, the software backend, Chromium without GPU
  compositing, or `OPENSCREEN_PREVIEW_READBACK=1` never enable it. A failed import or send
  turns it off for the view, and so does a first frame that lands transparent (a texture
  Chromium could not open, e.g. on another adapter): the composed frame is cleared opaque,
  so a transparent pixel can only be that. The render thread republishes the current
  frame on every switch, so the canvas never waits for something to move.

## Playback sync

The native view runs its own clock while playing, so the renderer only pushes a
seek when the user actually *moves* the playhead (scrub, step, or wrap-around to
a new clip). The mapping sits in
[`useNativePlaybackSync.ts`](../../src/native/useNativePlaybackSync.ts).

- **Play / pause → free-run.** `setNativePlaying` toggles the addon's free-run
  decoder. While playing, `currentTimeSec` ticks every rAF in the renderer;
  pushing that per tick would force a rewind+seek seek each frame *and* fight
  the addon's free-run (the render thread prioritises app-requested frames over
  free-run). So `useNativePlaybackSync` only pushes `setNativeTime` while the
  transport is paused.
- **RAW → native source.** The playhead `currentTimeSec` is in *RAW virtual*
  time (trims still occupy their space on the ruler — same reference the V4
  timeline and the webcam overlay use), but the native stream plays *compressed*
  segments (`resolveVisibleClips`, trims removed). `resolveNativePosition`
  bridges the two: it maps the RAW playhead via `document.timeline.clips` (the
  raw layout) to find the segment that contains it, then returns the segment's
  `clipIndex` + source time. Without this bridge a RAW playhead against a
  compressed clip list pointed at the wrong clip after a trim — wrong camera,
  misaligned screen.
- **Drift, measured rather than guessed.** Every frame carries where the view was when it
  composed it (`clipIndex`, `sourceTimeSec`, both transports), and
  `NativeCompositorOverlay` compares that with the playhead on the one timeline both share:
  programme time, the trim-compressed one, where a cut is no jump
  ([`nativeSync.ts`](../../src/native/nativeSync.ts)). A gap over 150 ms that holds for
  100 ms re-anchors the view with `setActiveClip`, at most every 500 ms. That covers a stall
  of the render thread and a jump by the user while playing. It replaced a guess from the
  wall clock at 1× speed, which inside a 2× speed region re-seeked the view ten times a
  second.

The overlay's rect is kept aligned with the DOM via the same primitives used
elsewhere in the renderer:

- `computeDeviceRect` (`src/native/nativeViewRect.ts`) turns
  `getBoundingClientRect()` into a device-pixel `CompositorViewRect`,
  rounding every axis to dodge the truncated / off-by-one windows the addon
  produces on non-integer inputs.
- `rectsEqual` skips the `setRect` push when nothing has changed
  ([`nativeViewRect.ts:33`](../../src/native/nativeViewRect.ts:33)) — the
  the ResizeObserver (`useNativeCompositorView.ts:259`) and a coalesced rAF
  schedule steady-state scrolling and resizes without re-pushing the rect.
- The overlay reuses the canvas's CSS `width: 100%; height: 100%` for its
  display box (`NativeCompositorOverlay.tsx:217`); the addon's `rect.x`/`rect.y`
  are vestigial (ignored native-side per
  [`addon.d.ts:18`](../../electron/native/compositor-view/addon.d.ts:18) and
  kept on the wire for source compatibility).

Clip changes across the playhead boundary are atomic at the
`setActiveClip(viewId, screenPath, webcamPath, webcamOffsetSec, clipIndex, sourceTimeSec)`
RPC
([`compositorViewClient.ts`](../../src/native/compositorViewClient.ts)), and who sends it
depends on the transport:

- **Paused** (scrub, step): `NativeCompositorOverlay` sends it whenever the playhead enters
  another clip.
- **Playing**: the render thread crosses into the next clip by itself, preloading it ahead
  of the cut. The overlay used to send the clip again at every cut, which made the view
  seek back to a place it had just left, or drop the clip it had preloaded: a hitch at
  every cut of an edited take. It now only sends it when the view is elsewhere — a jump
  (a click on the timeline, followed at once) or a gap the drift watch above catches.
  On a pause it also brings back a view left on another clip, before `setNativeTime`
  seeks in it.
- **An addon that reports no position** is driven as before: native is paused across the
  decoder swap, and the live transport is re-read *now* (not from a captured `isPlaying`)
  before resuming, so a user pause that lands mid-transition is honoured.

## When the decode clock fails

The hidden `<video>` is a clock and an audio source, not the picture — the
pixels come from the native canvas. So its failing is not the preview failing,
and the invariant since [#395](https://github.com/getopenscreen/openscreen/issues/395)
is: **a media error can never render `EditorEmptyState`**. That component now
answers exactly one question — is there anything in this project to show? — and
`Preview.tsx`'s render condition (`hasProject && hasAsset && previewSources.length > 0`)
takes no failure input at all.

What replaced it, in two layers:

- **Classify, then reload**
  ([`mediaError.ts`](../../src/components/ai-edition/mediaError.ts), applied in
  `VirtualPreview`'s `onError`). `MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED` is ignored outright and
  never counted: the `<video>` is keyed on `activeSource.id`, so every
  cross-asset clip boundary remounts it mid-load and Chromium reports exactly
  that. `MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED` gets one retry (a recording the capture
  process is still writing reports as unsupported); everything else — including
  an `error` event carrying no `MediaError` — rides `RETRY_DELAYS_MS`. The
  reload is a plain `load()`: re-assigning `src` first would start a second load
  that aborts the first and emit a spurious abort. The budget is re-armed by
  **playing past the position the failure happened at** (tracked in the rAF
  tick). Both obvious alternatives are wrong: never re-arming makes the third
  transient failure of a long session terminal — #395 with a longer fuse — while
  re-arming when the reload *completes* is worse still, because
  `loadedmetadata`/`canplay` prove the header parsed and the decoder is willing,
  not that the bytes that killed us are readable. A truncated recording re-fires
  both on every reload, so that version loops at 400 ms forever and never
  surfaces the card at all.
- **Resume through the existing path.** The reload queues `pendingSeekRef` and
  lets `onLoadedMetadata` restore position and playback — the same path a
  cross-asset seek uses, so the component has one resume path rather than two.
  The position is resolved **at reload time**, not when the error fired, because
  the user can scrub during the backoff: it comes from `locateVirtualPosition`
  against the live playhead, guarded by an `assetId` check (that function
  answers for whatever clip the playhead is on, which after a boundary advance
  can belong to a different asset), and falls back to a source time sampled
  while the decoder was known good. `video.currentTime` is *not* usable here —
  it reads 0 after `load()`.

While a reload is in flight the rAF tick returns early (`recoveringRef`),
publishing the clock but taking no decision. This cannot ride on the `v.paused`
gate the rest of the tick uses: an `error` does not fire `pause`, so a failure
during playback leaves `paused` false, and the tick would go on making
trim/boundary decisions against a frozen clock and clobber the queued resume.

Only once the budget is spent does `Preview` hear about it, and it renders
`PreviewErrorCard` **over** the still-mounted canvas — the last composed frame
stays visible, which is the evidence the project is intact. The card carries the
`MediaError` code, because a user's report is otherwise unactionable: the reason
#395 could only ever be described as "the preview disappeared" is that the code
was thrown away.

## Known gaps

- **Live preview is video-only.** `crates/compositor/src/live.rs` (1628 lines) handles only
  the video packet stream; audio is decoded and mixed in
  [`audio.rs::decode_clip_audio`](../../crates/compositor/src/audio.rs) for the export
  path and not for the live view. Editing playback is therefore silent against
  the exported file; users hear audio only when the export runs. There is no
  flag in this branch that re-routes live audio.
- **Drift under 150 ms is left alone.** The view and the app's clock run independently
  inside the drift watch's tolerance, and a correction is a seek, not a change of pace: a
  view drifting slowly is re-anchored with a visible step rather than eased back.
- **Shared textures are Windows-only.** macOS (an `IOSurface`-backed Metal texture) and
  Linux (a dmabuf exported from Vulkan) still read back: `sharedTexture` imports both, the
  native halves are not written.
- **Add-on absent = blank frame.** When `compositor_view.node` is missing
  (development with the addon not yet built, or a packaged build for an
  unsupported architecture) the overlay renders no pixels: only the DOM/CSS
  wallpaper and the interactive layers show. There is no CPU/Canvas2D fallback
  path; the live preview is gated on the addon being present.
