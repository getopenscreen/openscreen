# Build and packaging

OpenScreen builds its renderer, Electron main process, preload bridge, native helpers, and installers from the root npm scripts, `vite.config.ts`, `electron-builder.json5`, and platform-native projects under `electron/native/`. Nix provides a separate Linux package and development shell.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts Vite with the Electron plugin; builds and launches main/preload unless `NO_ELECTRON` is set. |
| `npm run build-vite` | Runs TypeScript checking and Vite only. It produces `dist/` and `dist-electron/` but no installer. |
| `npm run build` | Runs TypeScript checking, Vite, then unrestricted `electron-builder`. This is the full generic packaging command, but it does not proactively build platform helpers. **On Windows, prefer `build:win`** — see [Stale native artifacts](#stale-native-artifacts). |
| `npm run build:mac` | Builds the ScreenCaptureKit and cursor helpers, checks TypeScript, runs Vite, and packages the macOS target. |
| `npm run build:win` | Builds WGC/cursor helpers and the D3D11 compositor addon, fetches FFmpeg, checks TypeScript, runs Vite, and packages the Windows NSIS target without npm rebuild. |
| `npm run build:win:store` | Performs the Windows native and renderer build, then asks electron-builder for the configured AppX Store package. |
| `npm run build:linux` | Checks TypeScript, runs Vite, then packages AppImage, Debian, and pacman artifacts without npm rebuild. |
| `npm run build:native:mac` | Uses SwiftPM to build requested single-architecture ScreenCaptureKit and macOS cursor helpers and stages them under `electron/native/bin/darwin-*`. |
| `npm run build:native:win` | Uses CMake/Ninja in an MSVC environment to build WGC capture and cursor-sampler executables and stage x64 binaries. |
| `npm run build:native:compositor` | Uses Cargo/MSVC and the pinned shared FFmpeg SDK to build `compositor_view.node`. |
| `npm run build:whisper-binaries` | Runs the whisper.cpp CMake build and stages the speech-to-text executable plus ggml backend sidecars for the host. |
| `npm run fetch:ffmpeg` | Downloads and stages the FFmpeg binaries used by native Windows capture/compositing paths. |
| `nix build` | Builds the flake's default Linux package with system Electron rather than electron-builder. |
| `nix develop` | Opens the Linux Node/Electron/native-build/Playwright development shell defined by the flake. |

`vite.config.ts` uses `vite-plugin-electron` to compile `electron/main.ts` and `electron/preload.ts` into `dist-electron/` while Vite emits the renderer to `dist/`. The main `tsconfig.json` is strict, covers `src` and `electron`, and has `noEmit`; TypeScript is therefore a check while Vite performs emission. `build-vite` is the renderer/Electron-bundle build used when an installer is not needed, whereas `build` continues through electron-builder.

## Native artifacts

A usable full package depends on generated artifacts that are not committed:

| Artifact | Build/staging path | Toolchain |
|---|---|---|
| Windows WGC capture helper and cursor sampler | `electron/native/bin/win32-x64/` from `electron/native/wgc-capture/build/` | Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, Windows SDK, CMake, Ninja |
| macOS ScreenCaptureKit capture helper and cursor helper | `electron/native/bin/darwin-arm64/` or `darwin-x64/` | Full Xcode, Swift, SwiftPM; Command Line Tools alone may be insufficient |
| Whisper STT server and ggml/whisper backend libraries | `electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/` | CMake plus host compiler; Metal on Apple Silicon, Vulkan SDK on supported Windows/Linux builds, CPU fallback, optional CUDA |
| Native D3D11 compositor addon | `electron/native/compositor-view/build/compositor_view.node` | Rust MSVC toolchain, Visual Studio/Windows SDK, LLVM/libclang, and the exact pinned shared FFmpeg SDK |
| Native Metal compositor addon | `electron/native/bin/darwin-<arch>/compositor_view.node` (plus a dev copy under `electron/native/compositor-view/build/`) | Rust, Xcode, and the LGPL FFmpeg tree from `fetch:ffmpeg:mac` |
| FFmpeg runtime files | matching `electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/` directory | Downloaded by `fetch:ffmpeg` on Windows; **built from source** by `fetch:ffmpeg:mac` on macOS (~5 min) — BtbN publishes no macOS target and every circulating macOS build is GPL, which would relicense this MIT app |

Electron-builder copies only the matching `electron/native/bin/<platform>-<arch>/` directory into each package. The compositor `.node` file is included by the Windows `files` rule and unpacked from ASAR because native addons cannot be loaded from inside the archive.

`electron/native/bin/`, local native build directories, the compositor build output, models, and caches are gitignored. Rebuilding from a source checkout therefore requires the complete platform toolchain and third-party SDKs; running the generic `npm run build` alone does not manufacture missing native artifacts. The Windows compositor's D3D11/FFmpeg prerequisites are described by the source POC in `crates/README.md`, while capture helper lookup and output conventions are documented in `electron/native/README.md`.

### Stale native artifacts

**On Windows, always package with `npm run build:win`, not `npm run build`.**

`compositor_view.node` is gitignored, so it is whatever your last local Rust build produced. `npm run build` is `tsc && vite build && electron-builder` — it never invokes `build:native:compositor`. Only `build:win` does. Two ways this bites:

- You edit `crates/compositor/`, then package with `npm run build`. The installer gets the addon from before your edit.
- You create a worktree. Git does not copy gitignored files, so the worktree has no addon until one is built or copied in — usually an old one from the main checkout.

A stale addon **fails silently rather than erroring**. Scene fields are `#[serde(default)]` on the Rust side, so an addon that predates a contract change does not reject the payload: it ignores the unknown key, takes the default, and falls back to older behaviour. Nothing appears in any log, and the symptom ("the feature does nothing") is indistinguishable from a TypeScript bug. This is not hypothetical — on 2026-07-27 a build shipped an addon three days older than the commit adding `cursorSprites`, custom cursor themes silently rendered as the built-in art, and the resulting investigation blamed the wrong layer entirely.

`scripts/before-pack.cjs` runs as electron-builder's `beforePack` hook and fails the build when the addon is older than `crates/compositor/src/`, `crates/compositor-view-napi/src/`, or either `Cargo.toml`. The fix it prints is:

```bash
npm run build:native:compositor      # Windows
npm run build:native:compositor:mac  # macOS
```

**On macOS it also asserts the payload is complete**, which is a stronger check than freshness and exists because the hook used to return early on every non-Windows platform. That gap was not theoretical: the macOS CI job built the ScreenCaptureKit helper but never ran `fetch:ffmpeg:mac` or `build:native:compositor:mac`, so the `.app` it produced had no compositor addon — preview and export dead in the installed app, with nothing in any log. Nothing caught it, because the one guard that would have was Windows-only.

The hook now reads `electron/native/bin/darwin-<arch>/` — the directory `mac.extraResources` ships wholesale, so "present here" means "present in the installed app" — and refuses to package unless it holds all of:

| Required | Without it |
|---|---|
| `compositor_view.node` | preview and every export render nothing |
| `libavcodec/libavformat/libavutil.*.dylib` | the addon cannot load at all (dyld error at `require()`) |
| `whisper-stt-server` | transcription and captions fail with a developer error shown to end users |
| `libggml*.dylib` | the helper dies in dyld before `main()`; STT times out with no diagnostic |
| `openscreen-screencapturekit-helper` | native screen capture unavailable |

It then applies the same staleness comparison to the **shipped** addon (the arch-tagged copy), not the dev copy under `electron/native/compositor-view/build/`, since the arch-tagged one is what electron-builder actually packages.

CI: the Windows job runs `build:win`, which rebuilds before packaging. The macOS job spells its steps out — it needs `--dir` plus a hand-rolled DMG and signing — and had drifted from the `build:mac` recipe; it now vendors the LGPL ffmpeg tree and builds the Metal addon before packing, both cached.

The check compares modification times, so `git checkout` (which restamps source files) can occasionally flag an addon that is genuinely fine. That trade is deliberate — a false alarm costs one rebuild, whereas a missed stale addon ships a broken installer. Run `node scripts/before-pack.cjs` on its own to see the verdict without packaging.

Diagnosing a suspected stale addon: serde embeds its field-name literals in the compiled binary, so `grep -c <newCamelCaseField> compositor_view.node` returning 0 means the binary predates that contract.

## Platform packaging

### Windows

The default electron-builder target is NSIS, with an assisted installer that allows users to change the installation directory. `npm run build:win:store` explicitly selects the configured `appx` target for Microsoft Store packaging. The AppX identity, publisher, capabilities, and Store languages come from `electron-builder.json5`. Release CI builds and retains both the NSIS installer and AppX package, although the GitHub release publisher currently downloads only the `openscreen-windows` NSIS artifact.

#### Neither Windows artifact is signed

Unlike macOS, no Windows signing is configured anywhere in the repo. Both CI artifacts come out unsigned — confirmed by `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` on the 1.8.0 build:

| Artifact | Signature |
|---|---|
| `Openscreen.Setup.1.8.0.exe` | `NotSigned` |
| `Openscreen.Setup.1.8.0.appx` | `NotSigned` |

That the AppX is unsigned is not a defect: Microsoft signs Store submissions during certification, and the signed copy exists only in the Store. It is never handed back, so it cannot be redistributed. Two consequences worth knowing before anyone tries to "just ship the appx instead":

- **The AppX is not a drop-in replacement for the NSIS installer.** Windows runs an unsigned `.exe` after a SmartScreen prompt, but refuses outright to install an unsigned MSIX/AppX — sideloading requires a signature the machine already trusts. Swapping one for the other makes distribution strictly worse.
- **SmartScreen reputation is per file hash while the installer is unsigned**, so every release starts from zero and users meet the interstitial again on each new version. Signing would attach reputation to the publisher identity instead, and it would accumulate across releases.

Buying a certificate is the fix for the `.exe`, and it stays a live option (roughly €120/year for a cloud-HSM certificate an individual can buy, since the 2023 baseline requirements forbid keeping the key in a file). It was deliberately deferred: the Store route is already signed and already paid for through the developer account, so the README recommends it first and treats the `.exe` as the documented fallback.

### macOS

> **The macOS job is currently disabled** (`if: false` in `build.yml`) because 1.8.0 ships Windows-only. That flag is release-branch-only and must not reach `main` when promoting, or every later release becomes Windows-only too. Until it is lifted, the macOS packaging path — including the compositor and ffmpeg steps described above — is exercised only by `npm run build:mac` locally.

Electron-builder targets DMG for both `arm64` and `x64`, enables hardened runtime, and applies `macos.entitlements` to the app and inherited code. The entitlements allow Electron JIT/native library loading and audio, camera, and screen capture. The configuration itself sets `notarize: false`; release CI packages the `.app`, creates and signs the DMG manually, submits it to `notarytool`, staples the ticket, and validates Gatekeeper. Pre-release tags go through the same path as stable ones — signing alone leaves Gatekeeper at `rejected, source=Unnotarized Developer ID`, so an RC that is signed but not notarized still forces testers to clear the quarantine attribute. Missing Apple credentials produce an ad-hoc-signed artifact.

### Linux and Nix

Electron-builder produces AppImage, `.deb`, and `.pacman` targets. The flake separately supports `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`, offers NixOS and Home Manager modules, and builds a wrapper around nixpkgs' system Electron. `nix/package.nix` runs Vite directly, installs `dist/`, `dist-electron/`, production npm dependencies, wallpapers, icons, and a desktop entry; it does not invoke electron-builder. The release workflow later opens a PR to update the Nix package version and npm dependency hash after stable releases.

## Node and toolchain versions

`package.json#engines` and `.nvmrc` both pin Node.js `22.22.1`. The package manifest pins npm `10.9.4` through both `packageManager` and `engines.npm`. The Nix shell supplies Node 22, while the shared GitHub Actions setup currently requests the Node 22 release line rather than the exact patch.

TypeScript is `5.9.3`, Vite is `7.3.2`, Electron is `41.2.1`, and electron-builder is `26.8.1` in `package.json`. Native versions are controlled by their platform tools and project files rather than a single repository-wide compiler version.
