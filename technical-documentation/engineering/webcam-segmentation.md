# Webcam background segmentation

Where the AI cutout/blur/custom-background feature stands, the constraint that shapes it, and
the measurement that has to choose the next step.

Companion to [rendering-performance.md](rendering-performance.md), whose protocol §C.2 governs
every number quoted here.

## The principle at stake

Two decisions already in force bound this feature:

> **Compositing and encoding run in one native D3D11 engine**, shared by live preview and export.
> — [decisions.md](../architecture/decisions.md)

> A single `ID3D11Device`, zero CPU readback between stages.
> — [crates/README.md](../../crates/README.md)

The shader is the pixel SSOT. Preview and export are identical because they run *the same code*,
not because two implementations are kept in step by hand.

## What ships today

The camera is segmented **inside the native compositor**, on the same device that composites
it, and the mask reaches the pixel shader as a texture. Preview and export run the same code,
so they are identical by construction rather than by two implementations kept in step.

| stage | where |
|---|---|
| capture | `Compositor::capture_webcam_rgb` renders the webcam NV12 into a 256x144 RGBA target and reads it back |
| inference | `segmentation.rs`, ONNX Runtime CPU EP, own thread, 30 Hz, `intra_op_num_threads = 2` — **except during export**, see below |
| upload | `Compositor::set_webcam_mask`, from the render thread, into a DYNAMIC R8 texture (Windows) / a `Shared` R8 texture written by `replace_region` (Metal) / an R8 texture written by `Queue::write_texture` (wgpu) |
| composite | `ps_main`, `t3` / `texture(3)` / `@binding(4)`, branch on `fx.z` |

All three back-ends run all four stages.

**Same code is not the same as same pixels.** Running one implementation makes preview and export
agree on *what* is drawn; it does not by itself make them agree on *when* the mask is computed, and
that is where the invariant was actually lost. The live path is cadenced on the wall clock
(`should_run(Instant::now())`, 30 Hz) and infers on a worker thread — both right for a preview that
must never block. `render_timeline` renders frames as fast as the machine decodes, with no relation
to real time, and under that regime the same two choices are defects:

- the number of output frames one mask covers follows machine speed and momentary load, so **two
  exports of one project do not produce the same pixels**;
- the opening frames are composed before the worker's first mask exists, and
  `.filter(|_| mask.is_some())` turns the effect off entirely for them, so **the camera's real
  background is baked into the file** — the one thing the transparent mode exists to prevent.

`set_segmentation_deterministic(true)`, which `render_timeline` sets around its frame loop, swaps
both: one inference **per frame**, run **synchronously** on the render thread, so frame N carries a
mask computed from frame N's own camera image. It costs roughly 3 ms per frame, which an export can
afford and a preview cannot. That is the entire difference between the two modes — shader, model
and composite are identical.

The model is `public/mediapipe/selfie_segmentation/selfie_segmentation_landscape.onnx`, derived
from the vendored `.tflite` by `scripts/convert-selfie-segmentation-to-onnx.py`. Its path is
resolved by the **main process** in `resolveSceneAssetPaths`, the same place the wallpaper and
the cursor sprites are resolved: the renderer asks for an effect and knows nothing about the
disk.

Everything is inert until both a mode and a mask exist. No effect requested means no capture, no
inference and no upload — the feature costs exactly zero when off. A model that fails to load
turns the effect off with one log line rather than failing the frame.

**`ort` panics rather than erroring when its library is missing** — `load_dynamic::init(&path)
.expect("Failed to load ONNX Runtime dylib")` in `ort/src/lib.rs`. Without a guard, a build whose
ONNX Runtime was never staged would take down the render thread on the first frame with an effect
instead of degrading. `Segmenter::load` therefore checks `runtime_available()` before touching the
API at all, and wraps the session build in `catch_unwind` for the case where the file is present
but will not load. CI found this: the macOS and Linux Rust jobs have no library, and the first
version of these tests failed there rather than skipping.

### What this replaced

MediaPipe used to run in the renderer, and the layer had **two compositors**: a DOM `<canvas>`
in preview, and a composite baked into a video track for export. That is gone — the JS solution,
its two ~5.6 MB WASM builds, the `@mediapipe/selfie_segmentation` dependency, the export
pre-render and the `write-derived-media` IPC it needed. The `.tflite` files stay because the
`.onnx` is derived from them.

It also removes the limitation that made transparent export impossible: the mask is a texture,
not an alpha channel, so nothing has to survive a codec that cannot carry one.

### Not done

- **Intel macOS has no runtime staged**, so the effect stays off there. Upstream publishes no
  build for it; see *Staging* below.

## Staging the runtime

`scripts/fetch-onnxruntime.mjs`, wired into `build:mac`, `build:win`, `build:win:store` and
`build:linux`. The
crate links `ort` with `load-dynamic`, so nothing is needed to *build*; at runtime
`ensureOnnxRuntimeOnPath` looks for the library next to the addon in `electron/native/bin/<tag>/`,
the convention `whisper-stt` already uses. The script downloads the pinned upstream release,
verifies its SHA-256 **before** unpacking, checks the archive's own LICENSE really is MIT, and
lifts out exactly one file.

**The version is not free to move.** `crates/Cargo.toml` gives `ort` the feature `api-27`, which is
the minimum minor version it accepts — below it `GetApi` returns null and `ort` *panics* rather
than erroring. `scripts/fetch-onnxruntime.test.mjs` cross-checks the two pins, in both directions,
so a bump on either side cannot land alone. That coupling crosses a language boundary and is
invisible in review; it is the only thing standing between an `ort` bump and a render thread dying
on the first frame with an effect.

What it actually costs, measured on the 1.27.1 artifacts rather than estimated:

| target | library | size | shipped |
|---|---|---:|---|
| win32-x64 | `onnxruntime.dll` | 15.4 MB | yes |
| darwin-arm64 | `libonnxruntime.dylib` | 38.5 MB | yes |
| linux-x64 | `libonnxruntime.so` | 23.7 MB | yes |
| darwin-x64 | — | — | **no upstream build** |

Two things fall out of that table, and neither was the expectation:

- **macOS costs 2.5x what Windows does**, not the "roughly 15 MB per platform" this document
  previously assumed. `strip -x` takes the dylib from 38.5 MB to 23.7 MB, but stripping it would
  mean shipping something other than the artifact the SHA-256 pin vouches for, which is the whole
  point of pinning. Not done; noted in case the installer size ever forces the trade.
- **Intel Macs cannot have it at all.** Microsoft publishes no `osx-x86_64` or universal asset for
  any release from 1.27 on — arm64 is the only macOS target. The x64 DMG therefore ships without
  the library and the effect is simply absent there, degrading exactly as designed. Building it
  from source is the only way round it, and that is an ffmpeg-macos-sized script for a shrinking
  platform.

Linux was pinned but deliberately not wired in until its back-end gained the capture half — the
library would have been 23 MB of installer for a code path that could not run. That landed, so it
is wired now, and the same reasoning applies to `RightPanes.tsx`: the control is only worth showing
where a mask can actually reach the shader.

The **Linux compositor CI job stages it too**, as the macOS one does. Without a library on
`ORT_DYLIB_PATH`, `runtime_available()` is false and every segmentation test returns early — the
suite goes green having exercised no inference at all, which is exactly how the
`ort`-panics-when-absent bug got in.

`onnxruntime-node` was considered and rejected: 296 MB unpacked, which would roughly triple the
installer for three platforms' worth of providers we do not use.

## The constraint that shapes any fix

The mask must reach the shader as a texture. That part is cheap and identical under every
option: `t0`/`t1` are the webcam NV12 and `t2` is the wallpaper/sprite slot, so **`t3` is free**,
and `fx.y`/`fx.z` are unused in mode 0 and can carry mode + intensity.

```hlsl
Texture2D<float> texMask : register(t3);

// ps_main, mode < 0.5, after the motion-blur accumulation:
float m = texMask.Sample(samp, uv_now);        // 256x144, upscaled by the sampler
if      (effect > 2.5) rgb   = lerp(color.rgb, rgb, m);        // custom background
else if (effect > 1.5) rgb   = lerp(blur_bg(uv_now), rgb, m);  // blur
else if (effect > 0.5) alpha = alpha * m;                      // cutout
```

What is *not* cheap is producing that mask on the device that consumes it.

- The compositor renders on its own `ID3D11Device` in the **main** process — feature level 11_1
  only (`d3d_windows.rs:75` requests it, `:204` bails on anything else), default adapter (`pAdapter = None`), and
  `SetMultithreadProtected(true)`.
- MediaPipe runs in the **renderer** process. No JS API exposes a shared DXGI handle from ANGLE,
  so zero-copy between the two is unreachable from that side.
- **DirectML binds to a D3D12 device, not D3D11.** "Run ONNX Runtime on the compositor's device"
  is therefore not a thing; it needs D3D11↔D3D12 shared-handle interop on a matching adapter LUID.
- The Linux backend is **wgpu 24 + WGSL**, not raw Vulkan — `layer.wgsl`/`blur.wgsl` are compiled
  at runtime by naga. There is no SPIR-V toolchain to reuse and no raw `VkDevice` exposed.

## Options

| | A — transport the mask | B — inference in the compositor | C — hand-written compute |
|---|---|---|---|
| Preview and export ISO | no, still two compositors | yes, same code | yes, same code |
| New native runtime | none | one | none |
| GPU interop | n/a | D3D11↔D3D12 (Windows) | none, same device |
| Main risk | mask lags the frame it masks | queue contention; packaging ×5 | porting a CNN to 3 shading languages |

**A** is cheap and fixes the alpha loss, but regresses something that works today: the preview
mask is currently perfectly aligned, because MediaPipe segments the very frame the canvas draws.
Sourcing it from a second decoder means pairing by PTS and accepting a lag, which shows on
moving edges.

The choice between **B** and **C** turns on a single question — is the cost compute or overhead? —
which the next section answers. Read it before weighing the table above: it moves **C** from
"purist but too expensive" to the only option that addresses the measured bottleneck, because
fusion is exactly what an off-the-shelf runtime will not do for you.

## What the measurement found

Run of 2026-08-25 on a Radeon 610M (2 CU RDNA2, integrated — the pessimistic end of the target
class). Full report in [PR #493](https://github.com/getopenscreen/openscreen/pull/493#issuecomment-5410489010).

| | |
|---|---|
| Inference p50, DirectML | 3.803 ms |
| Inference p50, CPU EP | **3.575 ms — the CPU is faster** |
| Compositor alone | 11.07 ms/frame |
| With a 60 Hz inference load | 14.08 ms/frame (**+3.01 ms, −21.4 % throughput**) |
| Headroom at 60 fps | 5.60 ms → **2.59 ms** |

It passes the gate, but thinly, and +3.01 ms is a *floor*: it excludes the D3D11↔D3D12 interop,
the NV12→RGB preprocessing and the mask upload that the design actually adds.

### It is memory-bandwidth-bound per pixel — the overhead hypothesis was falsified

An earlier draft of this document argued the workload was overhead-bound: 66.65 MFLOP against a
~486 GFLOP/s device is 3.6 % of peak, and 48 of the 136 real ops have a 1x1 spatial output (one
convolution does 128 MACs in an entire dispatch). The prediction that followed — that shrinking
the input would *not* speed it up proportionally — was measured and **falsified**
([round 2](https://github.com/getopenscreen/openscreen/pull/493#issuecomment-5415093217)).

| resolution | pixels vs base | DML p10 | speedup | % of proportional | mask IoU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256x144 (shipped) | 1.00x | 3.092 ms | 1.00x | 100 % | 1.000 |
| 192x112 | 1.71x fewer | 2.014 ms | 1.53x | 90 % | **0.976** |
| 128x80 | 3.60x fewer | 1.172 ms | 2.64x | 73 % | 0.949 |
| 64x48 | 12.0x fewer | 0.639 ms | 4.84x | 40 % | 0.514 — model breaks |
| 256x256 (square) | 1.78x more | 5.065 ms | 0.61x | **109 %** | — |

The clinching point is the row going **up**: 1.78x the pixels for 1.63x the time. Time tracks
pixels in both directions. A least-squares fit gives a fixed overhead of **0.43 ms on DirectML**
— 14 % of the shipped-resolution cost, not the ~2-2.5 ms that had been predicted.

The Squeeze-and-Excitation plumbing *is* visible at node level (56 nodes, 14.7 % of node time,
near-zero arithmetic; 31,104x the MACs for 8.8x the time between the heaviest and lightest
convolution). But most of that plumbing — Transpose, Mul, Resize, Relu, Add — runs on
**full-resolution feature maps**, so its cost is per-pixel bandwidth, not per-dispatch overhead.
That is exactly why it vanishes when the input shrinks.

**The ALUs idle because the workload is bandwidth-limited, not because it waits on dispatch.**
"96 % idle" was a real number, read wrongly.

## Settled: ONNX Runtime CPU EP, 256x144, 30 Hz, two threads

[Round 3](https://github.com/getopenscreen/openscreen/pull/493#issuecomment-5416849856) measured
all four arms under contention. The result is not the margin, it is the shape:

| arm | ratio vs compositor alone | added ms/frame |
|---|---:|---:|
| control (pacing only, no inference) | 0.999 | — |
| DirectML, 256x144 | 0.897 | +1.03 |
| DirectML, 128x80 | 0.932 | +0.51 |
| **CPU EP, 256x144** | **0.943** | **+0.47** |
| CPU EP, 128x80 | 0.941 | +0.47 |

**DirectML's cost scales with pixels; the CPU EP's does not.** The CPU EP sits at +0.47 ms at
both resolutions, so **the CPU EP at full resolution is cheaper than DirectML ever gets even at
reduced resolution**. Against a 9.03 ms compositor frame, that is ~5 %.

**Thread count must be pinned.** On this 4-core box a default ORT session takes every core and
produces a p95 of **24.9 ms** — a dropped frame every time it fires. `intra_op_num_threads = 2`
is within 8 % of the best p10 with less than half the tail, and leaves two cores to the
compositor. Never ship the default.

**Resolution stays at 256x144.** IoU 0.949 flattered 128x80: as a PiP it is indistinguishable,
but with the camera fullscreen the mask is upscaled ~15x and soft-edge pixels go 3.1 % -> 8.1 %,
hair collapses into a ramp and the silhouette picks up a halo. 192x112 would be the safe reduced
option — but since the CPU EP is flat across resolution, there is no reason to reduce at all.

### Why this is the real prize

Choosing the CPU EP is not a latency decision, it is an architectural one:

- no DirectML means **no D3D12 device, no shared-handle interop, no adapter-LUID matching, no
  cross-queue fence** — the entire hardest piece of the Windows design disappears;
- nothing new in packaging;
- the mask comes back as a 36 KB CPU buffer and goes into `t3` as an ordinary texture **upload**,
  never a readback, so it never touches the blocking `Map(D3D11_MAP_READ)` that dominates preview
  cost;
- **the platform multiplier collapses to one code path.** "ORT has no Vulkan EP" stops mattering
  when no GPU EP is needed, so **Linux stops being the weak leg**.

### Still open

- **Linux, and it is now two questions rather than one.** The export path is already CPU-heavy, so
  giving two cores to inference may bite differently there — that was the original open point and
  it remains unmeasured. The port added a second: the capture is a synchronous readback on a
  preview path that already blocks on one, which is a *GPU*-side cost the CPU-EP argument above
  says nothing about. Both are §C.2 runs nobody has done.
- `allow_spinning = false` on the CPU thread pool, the obvious next contention knob.
- fp16/int8, reopened by round 2 and interacting with the provider choice now settled.

## Per platform

The three backends are not the same problem.

**Windows — D3D11, feature level 11_1.** DirectML binds to a **D3D12** device, so it needs adapter
LUID matching (`IDXGIFactory4::EnumAdapterByLuid`), a shared NT handle for the mask texture
(`CreateSharedHandle` → `ID3D11Device1::OpenSharedResource1`) and a shared fence
(`ID3D11Device5::OpenSharedFence` + `ID3D11DeviceContext4::Wait`). All present in the pinned
`windows` 0.58 crate, but `Win32_Graphics_Direct3D12` is not yet in the workspace feature list.
**A queue cannot be shared between a D3D11 and a D3D12 device — no API exists**, and with 2 CUs
there is no idle silicon for async compute to fill. That is a floor, not a tuning knob.
`onnxruntime-node` in `electron-builder.json5` is a stale comment, not a dependency.

**macOS — Metal, and the port is in.** Capture, upload and composite all run on the one
`MTLDevice` the compositor already shares with the encoder; there is no interop layer, because
the CPU EP made one unnecessary everywhere.

Indicative cost, M1 (8 GPU cores, macOS 26.5), 1280x720 preview including the synchronous
`readback_direct` the preview already pays, A/B/A/B interleaved, 300 frames per arm. **Not a
§C.2 run** — no fixture, no `--repeat 3`, its own harness — so it is a shape, not a quotable
number:

| arm | p50 | vs off |
|---|---:|---:|
| effect off | 3.04 ms | — |
| cutout | 2.57 ms | **−0.47 ms** |
| blur | 3.47 ms | +0.43 ms |

**Cutout is cheaper than no effect at all.** It drops the PiP drop shadow — one fewer full-quad
SDF draw — and that more than pays for everything the feature adds.

What these arms do **not** isolate is the capture itself. Cutout and blur do exactly the same
capture, inference and upload work (same 30 Hz limiter, same 256x144 readback); they differ only
by the shader branch and the shadow. So the 0.90 ms between them is shader work, and the capture
cost sits inside both arms unmeasured. Separating it needs a fourth arm — effect requested,
capture running, `fx.z` held at 0 — which is not a state the compositor can be asked for today.

The honest claim is therefore the net one: **on this machine the whole feature costs between
−0.47 and +0.43 ms per frame at 720p.** And it is a *this machine* claim — M1 unified memory
makes the `Private`→`Shared` blit nearly free, whereas on an Intel Mac with a discrete GPU it is
a real bus transfer. That has not been measured.

**The engine question, kept for the record.** `d3d_macos.rs:109-119` creates one `MTLDevice` and
one `MTLCommandQueue`, and `compositor_macos.rs:525-531` shows the compositor *clones* (retains)
them rather than making its own — preview and export already share the same objects. MPSGraph and
CoreML can take that same device: **no interop layer at all**, and CoreML may route to the ANE,
which would remove GPU contention entirely. Neither was needed once the CPU EP was settled. The
11.07 ms compositor baseline quoted above is a Radeon number and does not transfer — the M1
figure for the same shape of frame is the 3.04 ms in the table.

**Linux — wgpu 24 + WGSL, and the port is in.** `layer.wgsl` and `blur.wgsl` are compiled at
runtime by naga; there is no SPIR-V toolchain to reuse and no raw `VkDevice` exposed. That never
had to be solved: ONNX Runtime with a GPU EP is vendor-locked and unshippable to unknown
hardware, and the CPU EP made the question moot on every platform at once.

Capture, upload and composite all run on the one wgpu device the compositor already shares with
the encoder. Two things are specific to it. `copy_texture_to_buffer` demands a `bytes_per_row`
aligned to 256, so the capture pads its stride and depads on read — at 256x144 the padding is
nil, which is exactly why the depad has a test of its own at a width that needs it. And the
capture is a **second synchronous readback on the preview path**, which already pays one at
depth 1 (`live.rs`); it uses `WaitForSubmissionIndex` and not `Maintain::Wait`, the regression
`ReadbackRing`'s header records. That added cost is the one number this port could regress and
it is **not yet measured** — see *Still open*.

`libonnxruntime.so` risking a symbol collision with Chromium's protobuf/abseil remains a real
concern for *packaging*, and is untested: nothing stages the library yet (see *Not done*), so the
loaded-under-Electron case has never run. The compositor crate itself is unaffected — it links
`ort` with `load-dynamic` and resolves the library at runtime.

Only `texture(3)` / `t3` / `@binding(4)` is common to all three — the mask binding is mechanical
everywhere, and can be built before the engine question is settled.

## The experiment ladder

Run these before building anything; each can falsify the one after it.

- **E0 — prove the bound.** Sweep input resolution (256×144, 192×108, 128×72, 64×36) using the
  square variant already vendored at `selfie_segmentation.tflite`. If 16× fewer pixels is not
  ~16× faster — prediction: it lands at 2.5–3.5 ms against 3.803 — the workload is overhead-bound
  and levers 1–3 are where the time is.
- **E1 — 30 Hz.** The largest single win, and it is free.
- **E2 — ORT session hygiene.** Check whether whole-graph fusion was simply off: a run with it on
  would not report 32 separate `DmlFusedConv` nodes. Config keys must be confirmed against
  `onnxruntime_session_options_config_keys.h` for the pinned version — do not trust remembered
  spellings.
- **E3 — CPU EP under contention.** Re-run the bench with a CPU-side load instead of a GPU-side
  one. This is the arm that could keep the full 5.6 ms.
- **E4 — a fused SE block**, hand-written, timed against the runtime's version. This decides
  whether lever 3 is worth three implementations.

**Licence landmine:** RobustVideoMatting is GPL-3.0 against an MIT app. Do not vendor it.

## Why it was measured first

The interop was deliberately not built before this was answered. The ledger already records the directly
analogous outcome:

> **Encoder pipelining** — *Implemented and measured: a loss on the target integrated GPU,
> because encode and composite contend for the same queue.*

Per-frame inference is the same shape of work. The decisive question is whether the target
integrated GPU has the headroom, not whether the copies can be elided — the mask is 256×144 R8,
36 KB, and copying it was never the cost.

### What to measure

1. **Isolated inference latency.** ms per inference of MediaPipe SelfieSegmentation *landscape*
   (256×144) on the target GPU, p50 and p95, warm.
2. **Contention.** The C8 bench with and without a concurrent 60 Hz inference load on the same
   GPU. This needs no integration: a second process hammering the GPU answers "is there
   headroom" without a line of compositor code.

### Protocol

Governed by [rendering-performance.md](rendering-performance.md) §C.2, which is not optional:

- one full warm-up sweep discarded before any reported run;
- `--repeat 3`, interleaved A/B/A/B arms;
- **spread gate: a run above 15 % declares itself VOID** and is not quotable;
- a quiet machine — the documented VOID example had ~40 browser and Electron processes live;
- **only within-run ratios transfer between machines, never absolute times.** The deliverable is
  a ratio, not a frame time.

```
crates\x.bat run --release -- --cfg C0..C8 --fixture fixture --repeat 3 --out out\
```

`x.bat` wraps vcvars + ffmpeg-on-PATH + cargo. Its hardcoded Visual Studio path may need
adjusting per machine — the file says so itself. A worktree also has no `crates/thirdparty/`
(gitignored); it must be copied from a full checkout before anything builds.

### The gate

If inference costs ~6 ms on a frame budget of ~8, the design is dead on the target hardware and
the interop question never arises — the answer is then A, or staying with a pre-render. Decide on
the ratio, then build.

## Appendix — brief for the measurement

A self-contained brief for whoever (or whatever) runs this on the test machine lives in
[webcam-segmentation-bench-brief.md](webcam-segmentation-bench-brief.md).
