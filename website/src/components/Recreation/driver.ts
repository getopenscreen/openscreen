/**
 * Scroll in, custom properties out — plus one video seek and a handful of class

 *
 * Three rules keep it cheap.
 *
 * **One write target.** Everything lands on custom properties on `.stage`, so a
 * frame is a few dozen string assignments and no layout. The rail's contents,
 * the pills and the ruler all have static positions; only the rail is
 * translated.
 *
 * **Geometry is read once per resize, never per frame.** The demonstration
 * pointer aims at real controls — a swatch, a slider's 48% mark, a word in the
 * transcript — so those have to be measured. They are measured on attach and on
 * resize into a cache keyed by `data-t`, and the per-frame code only
 * interpolates between cached numbers. A target that is display:none when the
 * cache is built keeps its last known position, which is exactly right: the
 * pointer is heading for a control the panel is about to show.
 *
 * **The video is seeked, never played.** `currentTime` is the footage clock.
 * Seeks are issued latest-wins — one in flight, the newest pending value kept —
 * which is the fastest cadence the decoder can hold without building a queue.
