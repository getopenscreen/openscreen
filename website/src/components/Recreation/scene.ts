/**
 * The score, ported from the design's v4 cut.
 *
 * Time here is *scene seconds* — a clock that exists only on this page and runs
 * 0 → `T_TOTAL` as the reader scrolls the band. Every constant below is v4's,
 * kept to the number: the beat boundaries, the instants each click lands, where
 * each pill sits, and the two clocks' relationship.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM and nothing reads a clock. The driver calls
 * `frameAt(p)` and applies the result, which is what lets the whole score be
 * checked by a test that never opens a browser.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS STAGED ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The editor's *chrome* is the application's: panel titles, every slider's
 * range, scaling and suffix, the wallpapers, and the cursor packs with their
 * real hotspots all come out of `generated.ts`, which the generator emits by
 * reading the app's locale files and source.
 *
 * The *session* is staged. The transcript below, the five trims, the three
 * zooms and the speed ramp are the design's scenario, not the vendored
 * project file — they are a demonstration of what the editor does, composed to
 * read in twenty-six seconds. An earlier cut drove this from the project
 * document; the document's own edit is two trims at the two ends of a
 * forty-second take, which is truthful and shows almost nothing. The page says
 * which is which rather than implying the whole thing is a recording.
